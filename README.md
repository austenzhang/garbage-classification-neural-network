# Comparison of Multimodal Fusion Methods For Garbage Classification

This repository contains the Pytorch implementation of the Multimodal Fusion Comparison paper.

**Authors:** Steven Au, Laurel Flanagan, Rhys Wickens, Austen Zhang

## This repository contains:
- Jupyter Notebook Code for 5-fold cross validation for each fusion method
- Jupyter Notebook Code for evaluation of trained models
- Trained **.pth* models from experiment (access using Git LFS)

## Dependencies:
- PyTorch
- Anaconda (recommend Anaconda Miniforge3)

## Acknowledgements
The completion of this study would not have been possible without the invaluable support of Dr. Roberto Souza, who generously provided the dataset and offered his guidance throughout the research process.
